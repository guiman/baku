Node + Redis + Ruby + WiiMote = ????_API

Dependencies
------------

 * [Cwiid](https://github.com/wedesoft/cwiid)
 * [Redis](http://redis.io/)
 * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)

Objective
---------

This is an experimental project in witch the main idea it's to be able to interact with WiiMote IR camera information in a real-time way. To this purpose we will be using multiple technologies such as Rubys Cwiid gem (WiiMote interface), Redis(make data from cwiid flow in a network) and Node (use data delivered by Redis and expose it to the world! or do whatever you want to in a nodeway =D).
